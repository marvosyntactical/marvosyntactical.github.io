# Key ideas
- Bullet 1 — crisp claim.
- Bullet 2 — surprising angle.
- Bullet 3 — potential failure mode or falsifier.

## Abstract (2–4 sentences)
A tight summary of the main thesis and what changed in your thinking.

## Expanded notes
- Short paragraphs and bullets. Prefer equations for the crux.
- Keep references inline; add a references section at the end.

### Core derivations (sketches welcome)
Let the energy be $\\mathcal{E}[\\rho]$ on a state density $\\rho$. The WGF in $\\mathcal{P}_2$:
$$
\\partial_t \\rho_t = \\nabla \\cdot \\left( \\rho_t \\nabla \\frac{\\delta \\mathcal{E}}{\\delta \\rho}(\\rho_t) \\right).
$$
Add viscosity $\\nu$ and external drift $u$:
$$
\\partial_t \\rho_t + \\nabla\\cdot(\\rho_t u) = \\nu \\Delta \\rho_t + \\nabla\\cdot\\left(\\rho_t \\nabla \\frac{\\delta \\mathcal{E}}{\\delta \\rho}}\\right).
$$

### Connections & metaphors
- What does the attention kernel “want” thermodynamically?
- Which pieces look like Helmholtz decompositions?

### Open questions
- Q1.
- Q2.
- Q3.

### To try next
- [ ] Minimal toy experiment.
- [ ] Ablation that would break the claim if wrong.
